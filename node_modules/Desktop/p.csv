"This tool is an implementation of Design For Testing. New nets and logic are added to allow IC designs to be tested for errors in manufacturing. Physical imperfections can cause hard failures and variability can cause timing errors.
A simple DFT insertion consist of the following parts:
A scan_in pin where the test patterns are shifted in.
A scan_out pin where the test patterns are read from.
Scan cells that replace flops with registers that allow for testing.
One or more scan chains (shift registers created from your scan cells).
A scan_enable pin to allow your design to enter and leave the test mode.
TCL Commands

set_dft_config

set_dft_config [-max_length <int>]
               [-clock_mixing <string>]

-max_length: The maxinum number of bits that can be in each scan chain.
-clock_mixing: How architect will mix the scan flops based on the clock driver.
no_mix: Creates scan chains with only one type of clock and edge. This may create unbalanced chains.
clock_mix: Craetes scan chains mixing clocks and edges. Falling edge flops are going to be stitched before rising edge.
report_dft_config

report_dft_config

Prints the current DFT configuration to be used by preview_dft and insert_dft.
preview_dft

preview_dft [-verbose]

Prints a preview of the scan chains that will be stitched by insert_dft. Use this command to iterate and try different DFT configurations. This command do not perform any modification to the design.
-verbose: Shows more information about each one of the scan chains that will be created.
insert_dft

insert_dft

Implements the scan chains into the design by performing the following actions:
Scan Replace.
Scan Architect.
Scan Stitch.
The end result will be a design with scan flops connected to form the scan chains.
Example

This example will create scan chains with a max length of 10 bits mixing all the scan flops in the scan chains.
set_dft_config -max_length 10 -clock_mixing clock_mix
report_dft_config
preview_dft -verbose
insert_dft

Limitations

There are no optimizations for the scan chains. This is a WIP.
There is no way to specify existing scan ports to be used by scan insertion.
There is currently no way to define a user defined scan path.
We can only work with one bit cells.","So, you're asking about DFT, which stands for Design For Testing. It's a technique used to add testability to integrated circuits (ICs) during the design phase, allowing for more efficient and effective testing of the ICs during manufacturing.

In the context of the tool you're using, DFT involves adding new nets and logic to the design to enable testing. This includes adding scan cells, scan chains, and other components to allow for the shifting of test patterns into and out of the design.

The tool you're using provides several commands to implement DFT, including `set_dft_config`, `report_dft_config`, `preview_dft`, and `insert_dft`. These commands allow you to configure the DFT settings, preview the scan chains that will be created, and finally implement the DFT into the design.

The commands you've provided give you an idea of how to use these commands to implement DFT in your design. For example, you can set the maximum length of the scan chains to 10 bits and mix the scan flops based on the clock driver using the `set_dft_config` command.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.","DFT stands for Design for Testing. It is a process of adding additional logic and pins to a design to make it easier to test for errors in manufacturing. The DFT process involves adding scan-in and scan-out pins, scan cells, and scan chains to the design. These components allow the design to be tested for errors in manufacturing, such as physical imperfections and timing errors. The DFT process is important because it helps ensure that the final product meets the required quality standards and is free of defects. It also helps reduce the cost of testing and debugging the design, which can be very expensive if done manually. In OpenROAD, DFT is implemented through the use of TCL commands, which allow users to specify the desired DFT configuration and insert the necessary logic and pins into the design. The DFT process in OpenROAD is a simple and straightforward process that can be easily understood and implemented by users. It is a powerful tool that helps ensure the quality of the final product and reduces the cost of testing and debugging.",,,,
"OpenSTA is a gate level static timing verifier. As a stand-alone executable it can be used to verify the timing of a design using standard file formats. OpenSTA uses a TCL command interpreter to read the design, specify timing constraints and print timing reports.

","OpenSTA! It's a powerful tool in the OpenROAD ecosystem, specifically designed for gate-level static timing analysis. As you mentioned, it's a standalone executable that can verify the timing of a design using standard file formats.

From what I understand, OpenSTA uses a TCL command interpreter to read the design, specify timing constraints, and then print out timing reports. This allows designers to identify potential timing issues and optimize their design for better performance.

Regarding the clocks supported in OpenSTA, it looks like they cover a range of scenarios, including generated clocks, latency, source latency, uncertainty, propagated/ideal clocks, and gated clock checks. This flexibility is likely useful for designers working with complex clock domains and timing constraints.

If you have any more questions about OpenSTA or its capabilities, feel free to ask!","Parallax Static Timing Analyzer or OpenSTA is a gate level static timing verifier.
